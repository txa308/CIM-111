Its location in the Florida panhandle makes it a popular vacation destination for those across the Southeast and Midwest.

    <section id="grid3">
      <p>Panama City Beach was made infamous for its long history of spring break. Dating back to the 1980’s college students from across the Southeast and Midwest flocked to the area because of its affordability, location, and party culture. As a result of the 2014 spring break season city officials distanced themselves from this legacy and banned alcohol on the sandy beach during the month of March. This effectively ended spring break as people knew it.</p>

    <section id="grid4">
      <p>Hurricane Michael made landfall just to the east of Panama City Beach between Panama City and Mexico Beach in October 2018. Michael became the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the contiguous United States since Andrew 1992. It was strongest ever on record to hit the Florida panhandle. Michael was the fourth strongest landfalling hurricane in the United States in terms of windspeed and third strongest ever in terms of pressure. Micheal costed an estimated $25.1 billion. There were 50 total deaths in Florida alone. The area unfortunately will never be the same as the area sustained catastrophic damage and displaced thousands of people. Clean up and rebuild is still underway a little over a year later. Thankfully, Panama City Beach lies to the west, so the beach side was less affected but still saw significant damage. To the east, Panama City and neighboring Mexico Beach were leveled and significant clean up had to take place. Unfortunately, because of the size and awareness of the area folks who suffered greatly because of the storm saw very little help. Michael was hardly talked about in the national media and received significantly less donations and relief efforts compared to other storms. Thousands of people had to leave the area as homes, places of work, and schools were gone. Hurricane Michael has made a lasting impact on the community that will be felt for many years to come. </p>
