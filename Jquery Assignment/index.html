        $("#addhisinfo").html("On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of about 200. Within seven years it grew to more than 6,000 people. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837, and for several decades was the world's fastest-growing city. As the site of the Chicago Portage, the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, and the Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy. In 1871 the Great Chicago Fire occurred, which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, the city made a concerted effort to rebuild. The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by 1900, less than 30 years after the great fire, Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world.  In 1919, The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution made the production and sale of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters, including Al Capone, Dion O'Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era. The city also hosted the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention, which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall, with anti-war protesters, journalists and bystanders being beaten by police. Major construction projects took place in the late 60s and early 70s, including the Sears Tower (now known as the Willis Tower, which in 1974 became the world's tallest building), University of Illinois at Chicago, McCormick Place, and O'Hare International Airport.")

Dedicated in 1927, it is one of the largest fountains in the world. It operates from April to October, with regular water shows and evening color-light shows. During the winter, the fountain is decorated with festival lights. Another famous sightseeing attraction, Cloud Gate (more commonly known as The Bean), can be found in neighboring Millennium Park. Chicago is also home to a vast number of museums including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Field Museum and the Alder Planetarium as well as many more. Chicago is also home to the Lincoln Park Zoo and Shedd Aquarium. Observatory Decks located in the Willis Tower or the John Hancock Building provide great overviews of the city and are popular attractions. Chicago’s number one attraction is often considered the Navy Pier. Navy Pier attractions include sightseeing tours, restaurants, and shops for visitors to enjoy. The City of Chicago has plenty of other attractions, but these are often considered the best and most popular.")

The most popular Chicago-style foods are: The Chicago-style pizza is deep-dish pizza with a tall outer crust and large amounts of cheese, with chunky tomato sauce on top of the cheese instead of underneath it. The Chicago-style hot dog, traditionally a steamed or boiled, natural-casing all-beef wiener on a poppy-seed bun, topped with yellow mustard, chopped onion, sliced tomato, neon-green sweet-pickle relish, sport peppers, a dill pickle spear, and a sprinkling of celery salt—but never ketchup. Both of the foods are pictured below. The Italian beef is another staple of Chicago. It is a sandwich featuring thinly sliced roast beef simmered in a broth containing Italian-style seasonings and served on an Italian roll soaked in the meat juices. Most beef stands offer a cheesy beef option, which is typically the addition of a slice of provolone or mozzarella. A combo is a beef sandwich with the addition of grilled Italian sausage. Italian beef sandwiches are traditionally topped with sweet peppers or spicy giardiniera.")
